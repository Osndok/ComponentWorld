This is a Tapestry 5 web application intended to make it easier to find
Tapestry-compatible components, mixins, pages and modules. Its database
includes entries not only for the components that come with Tapestry, but also
those components (and mixins, pages, etc) that are available in third-party
modules, demo applications like JumpStart, blog posts and mailing lists.

This app has the exact same look and feel as the current Tapestry documentation
at https://tapestry.apache.org, and the hope is that it will eventually be
running under that URL and be seamlessly integrated into the official Tapestry
documentation.

In addition to its basic goal of helping people find Tapestry components, we
also have the following more ambitious goals:

* Serve as an example of how a polished and complete Tapestry 5 application
should be constructed. In that sense it is probably over-engineered, on purpose.

* Serve as examples of how to integrate other Apache products with Tapestry,
including Cayenne, Derby and Shiro.
